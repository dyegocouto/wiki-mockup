          <p>
            Charmander is a bipedal, <a href="#">reptilian Pokémon</a> with a
            primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest
            down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small
            fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower
            jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail, which
            has blazed there since Charmander's birth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flame can indicate Charmander's health and mood, burning
            brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted,
            wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is
            said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However,
            if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if
            it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in
            <a href="#">Pokémon Sleep</a>, Charmander is known to sleep while
            curled up.[1] Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the
            flame on its tail. During quiet nights, one can hear the sound of a
            flame burning if you listen hard enough while Charmander sleeps.
            Charmander has four different sleep styles it sleeps in:
            <em> Crackling Sleep </em>, <em>Tummy-Rub Sleep</em>,
            <em>Tummy-Up Sleep</em>, and <em>Atop-Belly Sleep</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charmander can be found in hot, <a href="#">mountainous areas</a>.
            It has been recently seen living in the <a href="#">Terarium</a> of
            <a href="#">Blueberry Academy</a>. However, it is found far more
            often in the ownership of <a href="#">Trainers</a>. As shown in
            <a href="#">Pokémon Snap</a> and <a href="#">New Pokémon Snap</a>,
            Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if
            it finds food and watching the flames on each other's tails to
            ensure they don't go out.
